## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running for development, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

You will need Node.js (version 18 or higher), a package manager (npm, yarn, or pnpm), and a Neon (or any other PostgreSQL) database. A browser with a wallet extension like MetaMask is required for blockchain features.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/your_username/producttrace.git](https://github.com/your_username/producttrace.git)
    cd producttrace
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root of your project by copying `.env.example` and fill in your credentials.
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    You will need to add keys for:
    * `DATABASE_URL` (from Neon or your PostgreSQL provider)
    * `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` & `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`
    * `STRIPE_API_KEY` & `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
    * `UPLOADTHING_SECRET` & `UPLOADTHING_APP_ID`
    * And other variables as defined in `env.mjs`.

4.  **Generate Prisma Client and Push Schema:**
    Apply the Prisma schema to your PostgreSQL database.
    ```bash
    npx prisma generate
    npx prisma db push
    ```

5.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
